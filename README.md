A set of packages that aim to take care of the 20% overlap between all
of the Haskell applications that you write.

Style
-----

This collection of packages uses the "MTL + Classy Optics" style of
composing the major components of an application.

For more information we highly recommend the talk by [George
Wilson](https://twitter.com/GeorgeTalksCode) entitled [Next Level MTL
with Classy Optics](https://talks.bfpg.org/talks/2015-06-09.next_level_mtl.html).

Packages
--------

* [crypto](crypto): Simplified cryptography operations.

* [opaleye](opaleye): Database queries and scheme migrations.

* [validation](validation): Data validation
